<div id="title"><h2>About Me</h2></div>
<p> With my birthday in August of 1995 I am now 20 years of age. I lived in Warren, MI for the first few years of my life and proceeded to move to Traverse City, MI where I have lived for the past 18 years. I attended Traverse City West Senior High and achieved a 3.74 GPA. I was part of National Honors Society and a member of the varsity hockey team. I earned two scholar athlete awards and the MIHL  David Mannino Award.</p>

<p>I decided to attend Michigan State University right when I got my acceptance letter on christmas day of 2012. I have been very active in the IM sports leagues and kept busy with my classes and job at the Michigan State University Help and Repair Center. I have been able to get experience through this job and other internships for my minor in Information Technology. </p>

<p>As my senior year in college rolles around I will continue to search for a job. It would be cool to be brought into a I.T. department and get started right out of college. I believe that all my experience and love for computers have prepared me well for my first full time job out of college. </p>
